# FluoView_FRAP_Parser
A tool to parse and analyze FRAP data generated by Olympus' FluoView software.

This is useful for quickly turning around FRAP data from FluoView. I change bits and pieces of it each time I use it so it is far from polished. It ingests the .csvs that are produced by FluoView, handles the variations in formatting, and returns a pandas dataframe along with some basic statistics about the series of recovery data that it has parsed.
